# ADF Monitor Pro â€” Architecture & Design

This document explains the system purpose, high-level and low-level architecture, data and process flows, Azure resources, and key operational concerns. Copy and adapt the Mermaid diagrams as needed.

## 1) Purpose & Scope
- Mission: Provide enterprise-grade monitoring, AI-assisted triage, and safe auto-recovery for Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines.
- Key outcomes: Faster incident response, fewer false alerts, consistent retries, and an auditable record of decisions.
- Primary users: Data engineers, platform engineers, SREs, and analytics teams.

## 2) Core Capabilities
- Real-time ADF pipeline monitoring (runs, failures, durations, trends)
- AI-powered failure analysis (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic)
- Safe retry logic with guardrails and thresholds
- Multi-environment support (Dev/Stage/Prod)
- Notifications (Teams, Slack, Email, SMS)
- Admin UI for configuration (Azure, AI providers, environments, security)
- Audit logging and observability (App Insights/Log Analytics)

## 3) High-Level Architecture

    U1[Data Engineers]
    U2[Platform Engineers]
    U3[SRE/Support]
  end

  subgraph WebApp[ADF Monitor Pro Web App (Streamlit)]
    UI[Admin UI & Dashboard]
    Cfg[Config Manager]
  end

  subgraph AzureCore[Azure]
    ADF[Azure Data Factory]
    OAISvc[Azure OpenAI / AI Providers]
    KV[Azure Key Vault]
    LAW[Log Analytics Workspace]
    AI[Application Insights]
  end

  Notif[Notifications (Teams/Slack/Email/SMS)]
  Store[(Logs/DB)]

```

Notes
- The Streamlit web app provides dashboards and an admin UI to configure Azure, AI providers, and environments.
- Service principal/managed identity retrieves secrets from Key Vault; observability flows to App Insights/Log Analytics.
- Notifications integrate with Teams/Slack/Email/SMS via webhooks or SMTP.

## 4) Low-Level Components

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Streamlit WebApp] --> B[Auth & RBAC]
  A --> C[Config Service]
  A --> D[ADF Client]
  A --> E[AI Analyzer]
  A --> F[Decision Engine]
  A --> G[Retry Orchestrator]
  A --> H[Notification Service]
  A --> I[Audit Logger]

  C --> KV[Key Vault Integration]
  D --> ADFAPI[ADF REST/SDK]
  E --> AIProv[OpenAI/Azure OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic]
  I --> Logs[(Log Store / DB)]
  A --> AppInsights[Application Insights]
  A --> LAW[Log Analytics Workspace]
```

Component responsibilities
- Auth & RBAC: Entra ID auth, role checks for admin vs viewer.
- Config Service: Load/save environment, Azure, AI, and security settings.
- ADF Client: Query pipeline runs, activity runs, and trigger retries where safe.
- AI Analyzer: Classify failure types, produce remediation guidance, explainability.
- Decision Engine: Guardrails; decides when to retry, alert, or escalate.
- Retry Orchestrator: Executes retries with backoff and max-attempts per policy.
- Notification Service: Channels (Teams/Slack/Email/SMS), batching and routing.
- Audit Logger: Structured logs of failures, decisions, and actions.

## 5) Data & Process Flows

### 5.1 Monitoring & Triage Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as Web UI (Streamlit)
  participant ADF as Azure Data Factory
  participant AI as AI Analyzer
  participant DEC as Decision Engine
  participant RET as Retry Orchestrator
  participant NOT as Notification Service
  participant AUD as Audit Logger

  UI->>ADF: Poll/Query pipeline runs
  ADF-->>UI: Runs + failures
  UI->>AI: Send error context
  AI-->>UI: Classification + recommendations
  UI->>DEC: Evaluate policies/guardrails
  DEC-->>UI: Action = retry | alert | escalate
  UI->>RET: If retry, orchestrate with limits
  RET-->>ADF: Trigger retry
  UI->>NOT: Send alerts (if needed)
  UI->>AUD: Persist decision + outcome
```

### 5.2 Admin Configuration Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant ADM as Admin User
  participant UI as Admin UI
  participant CFG as Config Service
  participant KV as Key Vault

  ADM->>UI: Update Azure/AI/Env/Security settings
  UI->>CFG: Validate & persist config
  CFG->>KV: Store/retrieve secrets
  UI-->>ADM: Save status + validation results
```

## 6) Azure Resources
- Azure Data Factory: Target(s) to monitor
- Azure OpenAI (or other AI providers): Model deployments (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini)
- App Service (Linux) or Container Apps: Host the Streamlit web application
- Azure Key Vault: Secret management (SP credentials, API keys, webhooks)
- Log Analytics Workspace + Application Insights: Telemetry and logs
- Storage Account or Azure SQL (optional): Long-term logs/exports
- Azure Monitor Action Group: Emails/Teams alerts
- Managed Identity or Service Principal: App auth to Azure services
- (Optional) Virtual Network + Private Endpoints + Private DNS zones

## 7) Environments & Access
- Environments: Dev, Stage, Prod with separate resource groups and settings
- RBAC roles (typical):
  - Data Factory Contributor (ADF targets)
  - Cognitive Services OpenAI User/Contributor (Azure OpenAI)
  - Monitoring Reader or Log Analytics Contributor (LAW)
  - Key Vault Secrets User (Key Vault)
  - Storage Blob Data Contributor (if Storage used)

## 8) Security & Compliance
- Secrets in Key Vault; never in code
- Managed identity preferred over client secrets when possible
- Network isolation and private endpoints for production
- Audit logs stored and retained per policy
- Align with tagging, naming, and policy standards

## 9) Non-Functional Requirements
- Availability: App Service multi-zone capable; retry logic resilient to transient faults
- Performance: Cached reads for ADF status; AI calls batched/throttled
- Scalability: Container Apps/App Service scale-out; LAW scalable
- Observability: App Insights dashboards, KQL queries for LAW
- Cost: Right-size SKUs; use model variants (mini) for dev/test

## 10) Use Cases
- NOC-style live monitoring of ADF pipelines
- Post-incident analysis with AI-generated summaries
- Automated retries for transient errors
- SLA reporting with historical trend analysis
- Multi-environment governance and drift detection

## 11) Deployment Options
- GitHub Codespaces for instant evaluation
- GitHub Actions CI/CD to App Service or Container Apps
- Docker/Compose for on-premise or other clouds

## 12) Future Enhancements
- Rule engine for custom triage policies
- Knowledge base integration from past incidents
- Webhooks for incident management tools (ServiceNow/Jira)
- RBAC syncing with Entra ID groups
